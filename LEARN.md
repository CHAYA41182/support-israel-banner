# Code Explanation

This `LEARN.md` file provides an overview of the core idea behind the code used to create a support banner for Israel.

## Core Idea

The main idea behind this code is to design a simple banner that expresses support for Israel. This banner is created using HTML and CSS. Let's break down the key elements of this idea:

1. **HTML Structure:** The HTML code defines the structure of the banner. It consists of a `<div>` element with the class "banner" containing the following elements:
   - Two blue lines for decoration.
   - A section with the class "support-israel__label," which displays the message "WE STAND WITH ISRAEL" along with an image of the Star of David.

2. **CSS Styling:** The CSS code provides styling to enhance the visual appeal of the banner. It does the following:
   - Centers the banner content both horizontally and vertically.
   - Sets the text color, font weight, and font size for the support message.
   - Adds styling to the blue and white lines for visual separation.

The result is a simple yet impactful banner that conveys a message of support for Israel.

This code can be easily customized for various purposes, making it a versatile tool for creating banners in different contexts.
